 Title Of Project : Smart Prenatal Health Care Monitoring System for pregnanacy Women In Rural Areas Using IoT.
   
  Excution Steps :
  1] Once the app starts working the device will starts debugging the code, then the device is going to search for a open WiFi with the  pre mentioned credentials.

	2] After connecting with the WiFi it will start to read the data from the sensor and it will collect the data from sensor and send it to the cloud .

	3] Once the data is sent to the cloud operations are done on the data received and also the data pre-processing take place.

	4] After the data is processed in the cloud along with all the calculations the process data is sent to the app.

	5] Then the app will display the processed data.
